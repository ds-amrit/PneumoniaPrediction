# PneumoniaPrediction
GOAL: Given a lung x-ray detect wheather it has pneumonia or its healthy using a machine learning model. Finally, deployed it using Flask application.

In this POC computer vision and machine learning are used to distinguish lung x-rays.

The dataset downloaded from kaggle has 

Set: train   normal images: 1575  pneumonia images:3875

Set: val   normal images: 8  pneumonia images:8

Set: test   normal images: 234  pneumonia images:390
